## General Info
Night Writer was a solo project assigned to us during week 5 of Mod 1 of 4 in Turing's School of Software & Design.
Our challenge was to create a program that translates English to Braille and Braille back to English.<br><br>
The idea of [Night Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_writing) was first developed for Napoleon’s army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light.
The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille’s development of his [Braille tactile writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille).
